# Myweather_Dashboard

## Description

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. 
- The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
- This is the sixth assignment for the bootcamp coding class.
- This project helped me to learn more about Third-party API, Server-side API, Client-side API, and how to do dynamic programming.
 
## Installation

To run the application successfully, we need Microsoft Visual Studio as an editor, Git Bash to clone the github repo and Chrome Dev Tools to inspect the code.

## Task 

-	HTML and CSS is used to design the interface.
-	No starter code was given, so had to start from the scratch.
-	This homework emphasized the importance of using JavaScript APIs to make dynamic changes to an HTML document.
-	This was a very hard assignment for me, which helped me to learn more about JS.

## Usage

## Comand line code

I used a lot of git commands like :
- git status
- git add -A
- git commit -m "Comment goes here"
- git branch
- git push
- git pull origin main
- git checkout main
- git checkout -b feature/add-branch

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Features

In my code I had 1 main branch and crated a few featured branch to test my code and update.
  - I worked on the basic starter code provided from the bootcamp.
  - Added the javaScript code to make it work.
  - Used inspect to monitor my code and it's performance.

## Summery
- This is a single day eight hour planner created by using HMTL, CSS and JS concept.
- The text filed represents tasks of the day which are manually added to the local storage.
- jQuery concept from JavaScript is used to get and set values from/to the local storage.
- A clear function was used to clear all the tasks.
- The header contains the local date and time that updates continuously.
- Day.js function was used for time calculation and formatting conversion at the top of the page.
- Color representation inclued: RED (for present hour), GRAY (for past hour) and GREEN (for future hour)

## How to Test

To test the homework, 
  - Please follow the deployed website link. 
  - Click the "Clear Field" button to reset schedule.
  - You can test the application different ways.
  - You can check the "Inspect -> Applications" to see the saved values.
